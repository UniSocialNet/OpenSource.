> As this post from Software Freedom Conservancy President Bradley M. Kuhn explains, the GPL linking exception lets developers like Google use OpenJDK in a proprietary project (or just with other licenses) by linking to it. Any changes you make to a GPL'd piece of software must also be open source, and normally any derivative works must also be open source.
